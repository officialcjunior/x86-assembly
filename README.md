# x86-assembly

These are some programs I wrote in Intel x86 assembly language.

## Setup
To run it, make sure that gcc and nasm are installed. 
`sudo apt install build-essential`


`sudo apt install gcc-multilib nasm`

## Compiling

`nasm -f elf filename.asm`


`gcc -m32 filiename.o -o filename`


`./filename`
